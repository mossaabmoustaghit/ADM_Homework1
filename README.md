# ADM HomeWork 1 (Mossaab MOUSTAGHIT)
In this repository,there are two important files: 
## Scripts.py 
This python file contains the codes for all the exercice made and submitted on HackerRank. I started with the problem 1 and then the problem 2 of all the challenges.
## Submissions_HackerRank_Merged.pdf 
This pdf file contains the pages of submissions of HackerRank  merged into one file.
## Comments 
I found that the most difficult and intresting part was Regex, I learned so much in this part. But I found out that the explanations of HackerRank weren't enough, so I searched on the internet just TO UNDERSTAND how it works. 
Hope I did good.
